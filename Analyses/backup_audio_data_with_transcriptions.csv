And I remember we had sort of riddles like this we would go through. So in which country would you bury the survivors? Survivors don't need to be buried because they are still alive. You wouldn't bury them unless you were a bit sadistic and were trying to kill them to begin with, which is potentially something crazy enough to happen in the US. So who knows?

And then the plane crashes. Half lands in the United States. The other half lands in Canada. In which country do you bury the survivors? I do not know. I'm trying to think. So if the plane crash landed in one half and the other half lands in Canada. I also don't know what the phrase crashes half lands means. That's a little confusing to me. In which country do you bury the survivors? Oh. So, okay, I just kept reading it, and then I read survivors. So you don't bury survivors. You bury deceased. So my process was just reading it and trying to visualize where the people would have landed, but then going through that process, I read survivors, which led me to the correct answer. So you do not bury survivors. Interesting question. All right, moving on."

Well, there you go. So now... It could mean initially. But then after doing that and determining... Obviously, there's a pattern with the pink that there may be some kind of trick going on due to the other questions. So that led me to reread it. And that one stood out pretty quick too, because it's the first part of this sentence in a one-story pink house. So one-story houses do not have stairs. Oh, typically, I guess a one-story house could have pink stairs if it was, you know, like stairs leading up to the house or out the back to the backyard.

A monkey, a squirrel, or a bird? Okay, well, I can't see the trick to this right away. So I'm going to rule out the squirrel, I think. Because I can't imagine a squirrel being in the same place a coconut tree was. Even though he is racing. I do think a monkey would probably be faster. And a bird... I guess it depends where they all started from and we don't know that so I'm gonna say I don't know or unable to determine to determine"
