Well  I would. I engaged how big the room is and then see if I can stumble across the lamb because then that's my best chance. I'm pretty fine in the dock  so I would just stick it out in the dark  let my eyes adjust vaguely. Try and find the oil lamp and then use my one match on the oil lamp. And then  if that doesn't work  research to find oil lamp for it's a bigger room than I expected. Um  then I would probably go for the newspaper  but I would try and do something clever like ripped it up. It's a long  thin pieces and then ban one end of the long  thin piece and then try and connect the long  thin pieces  so I've got more time for it to burn through the newspaper  give me a bit of light  then try and locate the oil man man  I could do to try and light director from the paper or  if I've got any matchstick left after having that the newspaper record  then just re like that. And then  like oil them or trying to find the piece of wood and take a splinter off like that  That's like oil. That that But yeah  hopefully oil I'm first.," If you have only one match and you would walk into a dark room where there is an oil lamp, a newspaper and wood, which thing would you like first? Well, I would try and gauge how big the room is and then see if I can stumble across the lamp because then that's my best chance.  I'm pretty fine in the dark. So I would just stick it out in the dark, let my eyes adjust, vaguely try and find the oil lamp and then use my one match on the oil lamp. And then if that doesn't work, if I'm really struggling to find the oil lamp or it's a bigger room than I expected, then I would probably go for the newspaper, but I would try and do something clever, like rip it up,  into long thin pieces and then burn one end of the long thin piece and then try and connect the long thin pieces so that I've got more time for it to burn through the newspaper and give me a bit of light to then try and locate the oil lamp and then I can either try and light it directly from the paper  Or if I've got any matchstick left after having lit the newspaper, I could then just relight that and then light the oil lamp. Or I'd try and find the piece of wood and take a splinter off it and light that and then try and light the oil lamp with that.

The egg is white. Nick is not quite the egg. White is white. So I reckon need a is the answer to this question as the yoke. It is yellow quite like that. This is not question off morality. Our white is white on the question. Look  the egg. Just wait the yolk of the egg.," Which sentence is correct? A. The yolk of the egg are white or B. The yolk of the egg is white. The yolk of the egg is not white. The egg white is white. So I reckon neither is the answer to this question as the yolk is orangey.  from yellow and the egg white. This is the white bit. This is not a question of plurality. As it suggests, whether it is white or whether it is white. But on the question of plurality, I would say the yolk of the egg is white as opposed to our white.

Well  crash crash is half Lansing it? Yeah  yeah. Grasslands in Canada. In which country do you bury? Survivors? What? I would say you bury them river. You want to? Um yeah," It's a stormy night and a plane takes off from JFK airport at New York. The storm worsens and the plane crashes. Oh, half lands in the United States. The other half lands in Canada. In which country do you bury the survivors?  Oh, so if the stormy night takes off in... Well, surely you bury the survivors in whatever country they live at. Just because you die in one country doesn't mean you have to be buried in that country, in my opinion. But then I'm a funeral director, so I would probably think that. So I would repatriate them back to wherever their families wanted them to go.  Yeah, so if a plane crash, well, crashes, half lands in, yeah, half lands in Canada, in which country do you bury the survivors? Well, I would say you bury them wherever you want to.

71,9,Would it be ethical for a man to marry the sister of his widow?,Not possible,Yes / No,Lure,Maybe - depending on the situation.,would it be ethical for a man to marry the sister of his widow?

But he was kind of the done thing. So maybe maybe depending on the situation and not really sort of sure where that would go if that I'm starting to think that might have been a trick question but I'm not really sure.

83,7,The wind blows west. An electric train runs east. In which direction does the smoke blow?,No smoke,West,Reflect,It doesn't because electric trains don't have steam engines,only if I get any points for missing the question. Okay  The wind blows west. Okay. On electric train runs east. Okay. In which cardinal direction does the smoke from the locomotive brew? I don't like this. Ah  this is really this is this is no great. No  I have to do get my bearings. Right. Um  okay. Or maybe I don't have to think for this one either. I'm getting okay. Okay. Um ah  the wind blows west. Okay  so it blows to the wait like it blows from the east to the west. Yes. Yes. Okay. Okay. Ah. Okay. So if we electric train electric trains I knew it. I didn't have to think. What? Because electric trains don't have steam engines. Um  so what's the question In which kind of American does the smoke from local woods of blue? It doesn't because it doesn't. I need to pay more attention to descend. It doesn't because electric trains don't have steam engines. Okay  if you're thinking too hard  it's probably wrong.," I wonder if I get any points for missing a question. Okay. The wind blows west, okay? An electric train runs east, okay? In which cardinal direction does the smoke from the locomotive blow?  I don't like this. Ah, this is really, this is, this is not great. Now I have to do, get my bearings right. Um, okay. Or maybe I don't have to think for this one either. Ah, I'm getting... Um, okay, okay, okay. Um, uh, the wind blows west, okay? So it blows to the... Wait...  Like it blows from the east to the west? Yes. Yes. Okay. Okay. Uh...  Okay, so if... Wait, electric train... Electric trains! I knew it! I didn't have to think much because electric trains don't have steam engines. So what's the question? In which canal direction does the smoke from locomotive blow? It doesn't because... It doesn't. I need to pay more attention to detail. It doesn't because electric trains don't have steam engines.

How many of each animal did Moses put on the ark? Um I am assuming two of each because animals need to procreate. You couldn't put just one is how would they made and re populate. So you read it one more time Make sure I'm not missing. After inferring that maybe it means two of each animal. I was able to read and catch the Moses. So it was Noah's ark. Moses is um yeah. So at first I was you know thinking that may be put to a beach because I would have to make but yeah another trick question.," How many of each animal did Moses put on the ark? How many? I don't know. How many of each animal did Moses put on the ark? I am assuming two of each, because animals need to procreate. You couldn't put just one, because how would they mate and repopulate? So let me read it one more time to make sure I'm not missing it.  After inferring that maybe it means two of each animal, I was able to read and catch the Moses. So it was Noah's Ark. Not Moses's.
