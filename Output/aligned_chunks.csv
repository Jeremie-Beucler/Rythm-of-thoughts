22,1,4,"So Mary is one of the children, I guess.",29.557,37.307

22,3,2,okay well I would imagine the survivors would be repatriated back to the countries that they they came from and so they could have come from all over the world I'm guessing so it depends what country they actually came from,27.318,51.587

22,4,4,They're all capable of getting there first but I suppose the monkey might be more interested in the banana.,19.798,30.072
22,4,5,So I think probably the monkey although the squirrel is very fast and could get to the top of the tree really quick the bird could fly up there but monkeys are very agile and they do like bananas so I would be going for the monkey.,30.052,47.217

22,5,3,well at first I was going to say that the stairs would be pink probably because everything else is pink,21.209,28.92
22,5,4,but then I remembered it was a one-story house so therefore there wouldn't actually have been any stairs,29.441,36.51

99,4,3,"I mean, ultimately, my monkey would get it because a bird isn't going to, like, because if they're in packs, swirl isn't going to eat a banana because it's too big, and they're also in the northern hemisphere mostly, so.",19.574,28.283

102,2,3,I'm running a race and I passed the person that's in second place.,8.865,12.991
102,2,4,So I would have been in third place.,13.853,15.435
102,2,5,So then I would be in second place because the person that was in second place would be behind me and they would be in third place.,15.796,21.925

102,3,1,It's a stormy night and a plane takes off from JFK Airport in New York. The storm worsens and the plane crashes half lands.,1.06,11.453
102,3,2,Let me read that again. It's a stormy night and a plane takes off from JFK Airport in New York. The storm worsens and the plane crashes half lands in the United States. The other half lands in Canada.,12.555,24.91
102,3,3,"In which country do you bury the survivors? Okay, I'm not sure.  Dork.",25.531,35.156
102,3,4,And then the plane crashes. Half lands in the United States. The other half lands in Canada. In which country do you bury the survivors? I do not know.,37.038,49.331
102,3,5,I'm trying to think. So if the plane crash landed in one half and the other half lands in Canada. I also don't know what the phrase crashes half lands.  That's a little confusing to me.,49.932,65.525
102,3,6,"In which country do you bury the survivors? Oh. So, okay, I just kept reading it, and then I read survivors. So you don't bury survivors. You bury deceased.",66.186,79.702
102,3,7,"So my process was just reading it and trying to visualize where the people would have landed, but then going through that process, I read survivors, which led me to the correct answer.  So you do not bury survivors. Interesting question.",80.643,103.202
102,3,8,"All right, moving on.",103.222,104.085
102,4,1,"A monkey, a squirrel, and a bird are racing to the top of a coconut tree. Who will get the banana first? The monkey, the squirrel, or the bird?",0.807,10.235

102,4,3,"Okay, so there's no bananas and coconut trees. That one was pretty easy.",19.904,27.951
102,4,4,"As I read through it once, I was just kind of  to immediately reread it because that's how I process and obviously that one stood out pretty quickly so coconut trees do not have bananas that one came pretty naturally I didn't have to think too hard it was just word recognition and noticing the difference",28.031,59.074
102,4,5,also using the prior questions I guess I think  Subconsciously the prior questions are kind of leading me to the correct way of viewing the question.,59.836,72.242
102,5,1,"In a one-story pink house, there was a pink person, a pink cat, a pink fish, a pink computer, a pink chair, a pink table, a pink telephone, a pink shower. Everything was pink. What color were the stairs, probably?",1.077,17.861
102,5,2,"So, obviously, I'm thinking pink. If the pattern is everything's pink, I'm going to read through it again.",18.722,26.713
102,5,3,"In a one-story house. Well, there you go.",26.854,29.397
102,5,4,"So now...  but it could mean initially. But then after doing that and determining, obviously there's a pattern with the pink, that there may be some kind of trick going on due to the other questions.",29.417,48.191
102,5,5,"So that led me to reread it. And that one stood out pretty quick too, because it's the first part of this sentence in a one-story pink house.",49.332,58.26
102,5,6,So one-story houses do not have stairs.,60.242,64.345
102,5,7,"Typically, I guess a one-story house could have pink stairs if it was stairs leading up to the house or out the back to the backyard.",66.333,77.502

102,6,1,How many of each animal did Moses put on the ark? How many? I don't know.,1.313,8.464
102,6,2,"How many of each animal did Moses put on the ark? I am assuming two of each, because animals need to procreate.",8.504,18.88
102,6,3,"You couldn't put just one, because how would they mate and repopulate?",19.521,25.089
102,6,4,So let me read it one more time to make sure I'm not missing it.,25.91,30.257
102,6,5,"After inferring that maybe it means two of each animal, I was able to read and catch the Moses.",34.692,43.509
102,6,6,So it was Noah's Ark. Not Moses's.,44.251,52.246
102,6,7,Yeah. Yeah.,55.913,56.194
102,6,8,"So at first, I was thinking that maybe he put two of each because they would have to mate.",56.765,63.002
102,6,9,"But yeah, another trick question.",63.203,65.155
102,7,1,The wind blows west. An electric train runs east. In which cardinal direction does the smoke from the locomotive blow?,0.79,9.339
102,7,2,"Okay, so it's an electric train. It doesn't have smoke. That one's simple.",9.899,15.945
102,7,3,"My process for this was really segmenting the question down. So I got the wind, I got the electric train, and then I got the smoke.",17.027,26.456
102,7,4,"The smoke and the wind would link up, but it being an electric train,  Electric trains do not produce smoke and moving on.",26.937,41.445
102,8,1,"If you have only one match, okay, so we have one match, and you walk into a dark room, okay, so a room that is dark where there is an oil lamp.",0.031,8.643

102,8,3,"Which thing would you light first? If you have one match, so which of these things would I light first?",14.671,21.84
102,8,4,"I'm going through the items. There is an oil lamp, a newspaper, and wood.",23.963,28.249
102,8,5,"I mean, if this was as plain as it seems, you would have liked the wood, I mean the newspaper, and then maybe the oil lamp?",34.793,46.906
102,8,6,"If you have only one match and you walk into a dark room where there... Well, now I'm thinking that if you walked into a dark room with these items...",49.268,59.839
102,8,7,How would you light them? You wouldn't be able to see to light them.,60.173,63.479
102,8,8,"So I think that's my answer. Yeah. So in a dark room, how would you be able to light any item without being able to see?",63.72,81.675
102,8,9,"Yeah, so that would be my answer. I'm pretty sure that's correct.",83.258,88.312
102,8,10,"Other than that, I guess the oil lamp?",88.694,91.241
102,8,11,"Okay, well, I'm moving on.",93.226,94.129
102,9,1,"Would it be ethical for a man to marry the sister of his widow? So wait, the sister of his widow.",1.094,8.16
102,9,2,Would it be ethical for a man to marry the sister of his widow? So his dead wife's sister.,10.142,17.148
102,9,3,I don't see whether it wouldn't be ethical.,20.071,21.812
102,9,4,I think I'm missing something here.,22.673,24.335
102,9,5,Would it be ethical for a man to marry the sister of his widow? Sister of his widow.,24.415,30.24
102,9,6,Yes.,35.772,36.313
102,9,7,"But knowing the other questions, I'm assuming I'm missing something.",37.675,40.7
102,9,8,"So the sister of his widow, his wife, his widow would be deceased.",43.744,49.633
102,9,9,Hmm.,53.139,53.219
102,9,10,I can't think of any answer other than yes.,53.239,55.823
102,9,11,So I'm just going to put yes and assume I'm not seeing the hidden meaning here.,56.223,61.391
102,9,12,Wife's.,62.673,63.214
102,9,13,To marry the sister of his widow.,63.768,65.632
102,9,14,It would be ethical.,65.652,70.504
102,9,15,Yes.,71.827,72.188
102,9,16,"Yeah, I don't know.",75.336,79.185
102,9,17,I just can't think of anything other than yes.,79.746,83.294

102,10,3,"I mean B, but the yolk of the egg is yellow.",16.987,20.291
102,10,4,So I was thinking which of those grammar-wise was correct.,21.472,26.897
102,10,5,"When you read it, one just sounds wrong as you're reading it.",27.337,30.24
102,10,6,it's not proper English the yolk of egg is white is proper English so I was able to read that but yeah yolks are yellow so you'll of eggs are yellow white,34.76,52.355
