The storm worsens and the plane crashes. Half lands in the United States, the other half lands in Canada. In which country would you bury the survivors? So right away, I've heard this one from when I, it reminded me of like actually being in elementary school and in a certain classroom where I think I heard this. And it's one of those sort of riddles. And sadly, this makes me feel terrible to admit this, but I was in gifted class. I'm still not sure what that means. And I remember we had sort of riddles like this we would go through. So in which country would you bury the survivors? Survivors don't need to be buried because they are still alive. You wouldn't bury them unless you were a bit sadistic and were trying to kill them to begin with, which is potentially something crazy enough to happen in the US. So who knows? So my response is you wouldn't bury them. Bury them. Oh, we're not busy though. Bury them.","[
